# Daylio Expanded Analytics Suite (WT)

Need to have a GUI, need to read in CSV, needs to run A Priori or something to that effect, needs to present those results.

## GUI
Tkinter's a boy. Plotly? Matlibplot? PyGUI? Heard decent things about PyGUI.

## CSV
We've got them tools anyway. I think that class design is one of the more important ones.
* Read it all in
* Create mood, activity dictionairies
* Then drop 'em into whatever data structure we design. Yeah.

## A PRIORI

## RESULT PRESENTATION
Prob not gonna be great straight up. I don't image it'll ne _too_ graphy. 
Q: How do we store rules?
